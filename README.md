# PersonalWeb
  This was me talking some time to get a personal site down that I'm happy with...for now. I used my HTML and CSS knowlegde with the JavaScript library know as Gsap. I cooked up some nice animations and organized the sections and put some good links into it. I really got a chance to be more comfortable building a website from scratch.
